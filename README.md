To determine whether the bill length affects the bill depth within species, I'll firstly consider a linear regression model.

Bill Depth = B_0 + B_1 * Bill Length + e (here e is the error term)

After fitting the model, we would need to verify that the residuals have the same variance along different observations of bill length.
